N827	video	popculture	Following Trump's endorsement, Spicer has emotional night on 'Dancing With the Star'	It was an emotional night for Sean Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, Monday. President Trump's former press secretary dedicated his performance to his father, who passed away in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. "This is an opportunity to pay homage to my father, a great man, a great friend, a great inspiration," said Spicer, ""I'd like to dedicate this dance to my dad and all the fathers out there suffering from cancer but still being the best dad that they can." The theme of the show was Disney Night and Spicer danced as the character Woody from Toy Story 4. His quickstep was his most well received dance and he earned his first 7 score from the judges. After his performance, Spicer became emotional because Disney Night reminded him of one of his last memories with his father. "It was a great experience to be able to share that whole experience with my kids and my mother and father," said Spicer, "So to know that it was actually the ride that we went on, it was kind of cool."	https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/popculture/following-trump's-endorsement,-spicer-has-emotional-night-on-'dancing-with-the-star'/vi-AAINblw?ocid=chopendata	[{"Label": "Sean Spicer", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q27829251", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [31], "SurfaceForms": ["Spicer"]}, {"Label": "Donald Trump", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q22686", "Confidence": 0.972, "OccurrenceOffsets": [10], "SurfaceForms": ["Trump"]}]	[{"Label": "Sean Spicer", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q27829251", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [30, 315, 507, 681, 898], "SurfaceForms": ["Sean Spicer", "Spicer", "Spicer", "Spicer", "Spicer"]}, {"Label": "Toy Story 4", "Type": "N", "WikidataId": "Q18517638", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [549], "SurfaceForms": ["Toy Story 4"]}, {"Label": "Sheriff Woody", "Type": "R", "WikidataId": "Q2290907", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [538], "SurfaceForms": ["Woody"]}, {"Label": "Donald Trump", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q22686", "Confidence": 0.972, "OccurrenceOffsets": [77], "SurfaceForms": ["President Trump"]}]

Read on to learn about 15 abandoned places you can explore only through photographs unless, that is, you're willing to risk a trespassing charge (something we strongly discourage). Though abandoned, many of these locations are still private property, and while some aren't technically off-limits, concerns about toxins, deteriorating structures, and other dangers should offer a strong deterrent.	https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyledidyouknow/15-abandoned-places-that-you-can-see-only-in-pictures/ss-AAHfRcY?ocid=chopendata	[{"Label": "Abandoned Places: A Time for Heroes", "Type": "U", "WikidataId": "Q339348", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [3], "SurfaceForms": ["Abandoned Places"]}]	[{"Label": "Google Maps", "Type": "M", "WikidataId": "Q12013", "Confidence": 0.922, "OccurrenceOffsets": [43], "SurfaceForms": ["Google Maps"]}, {"Label": "Abandoned Places: A Time for Heroes", "Type": "U", "WikidataId": "Q339348", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [422], "SurfaceForms": ["abandoned places"]}, {"Label": "United States", "Type": "G", "WikidataId": "Q30", "Confidence": 0.965, "OccurrenceOffsets": [229], "SurfaceForms": ["United States"]}]

N6343	music	music-gallery	The best hair metal bands	The hair, or glam, metal bands of the 1980s remain one of the true guilty pleasures in the history of music. The hair spray, makeup and catchy pop tunes touched up with distortion were made for MTV. Though there really wasn't much substance to the music, the scene was popular to the mainstream nonetheless. So we've decided to rank our 20 hair metal bands of all time. But before we go on, bands like Def Leppard, Kiss, Scorpions, Whitesnake, Extreme and Tesla are not on this list. While, yes, some of these groups made massively successful pop-tinged metal albums during the '80s, they were either already successfully established hard-rock acts before this time and went for some easy money or were unjustly lumped into the genre thanks to MTV.

Evacuation orders were expanded in Sonoma County on Sunday as the Kincade Fire continued to spread, aided by high winds and low humidity, CalFire said. Photographer Craig Philpott said he captured this video as he traveled home on Highway 128 in Sonoma County in the early hours of Sunday morning. The video shows flames and fallen trees at the roadside, as well as smoke engulfing the route at one point. Philpott said he was forced to turn around and take an alternative route home.

N21499	video	animals	Gigantic bull "moos" his appreciation when he gets his ear scratched	Gus is a 2,000 pound bull who lives on a beautiful farm in Millbrook, Ontario. He is a true gentle giant with a gentle disposition and a friendly nature. He wanders among his herd of cows who are also very happy here on this small chunk of paradise. They have hundreds of acres of lush, green meadow to graze on and ponds full of fresh water to drink. They even have a scratching post with brushes for soothing those itches. Gus is a big boy with big ears and a big itch inside one of them. He patiently waited for his turn at the post while Ethel had a good scratch. When he had the chance, he moved in for some relief. He rubbed his head and his ear and he seemed intent on trying to fit the big brush inside his ear to get at the right spot. Gus' buddy, Dave was watching all of this. Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few "moos" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it's because Gus isn't threatened by anything, or maybe it's sheer luck that he's so relaxed, but he doesn't ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected.	https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/animals/gigantic-bull-"moos"-his-appreciation-when-he-gets-his-ear-scratched/vi-AAISKxN?ocid=chopendata	[{"Label": "Gigantic (film)", "Type": "W", "WikidataId": "Q3105463", "Confidence": 0.948, "OccurrenceOffsets": [0], "SurfaceForms": ["Gigantic"]}]	[{"Label": "Gus (1976 film)", "Type": "W", "WikidataId": "Q3120992", "Confidence": 0.97, "OccurrenceOffsets": [0, 425, 745, 838, 884, 1001, 1088, 1171, 1377, 1448, 1466, 1621, 1800, 2046], "SurfaceForms": ["Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus", "Gus"]}, {"Label": "Cavan Monaghan", "Type": "G", "WikidataId": "Q4116647", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [59], "SurfaceForms": ["Millbrook"]}, {"Label": "Ethel, Ontario", "Type": "G", "WikidataId": "Q14875146", "Confidence": 0.999, "OccurrenceOffsets": [542], "SurfaceForms": ["Ethel"]}]
